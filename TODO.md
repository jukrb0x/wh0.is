Problems I met during the development:

1. neovim tresitter support for mdx is not ok
2. prettier will consider mdx as markdown file so that the comment block won't work after formatting
3. ~~the latest `@unocss/postcss` plugin can cause stucking at dev compiling~~

**Website Roadmap:**

-   [ ] `high` table of contents
-   [ ] `high` figure caption
-   [ ] `low` search
-   [ ] `medium` meta data for SEO, Security, etc
-   [ ] table is not fit the container 100%
-   [ ] link with icons, friends, migrating contents
-   [ ] 404 page
-   [ ] `low` external link icon (mask?) after pseudo element, align center, prevent line break
-   [ ] design the website icon/favicon
-   [ ] `low` profiling and speed optimization
-   [ ] `maybe` image popup on click
