Problems I met during the development:

1. neovim tresitter support for mdx is not ok
2. prettier will consider mdx as markdown file so that the comment block won't work after formatting
3. the latest `@unocss/postcss` plugin can cause stucking at dev compiling

Roadmap:

-   [ ] code block highlighting
-   [ ] mdx styles are broken
-   [ ] `code` dark scheme color not changed
-   [ ] profiling and speed optimization
