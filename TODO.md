Problems I met during the development:

1. neovim tresitter support for mdx is not ok
2. prettier will consider mdx as markdown file so that the comment block won't work after formatting
3. the latest `@unocss/postcss` plugin can cause stucking at dev compiling

Website Roadmap:

-   [ ] table of contents
-   [ ] table is not fit the container 100%
-   [ ] profiling and speed optimization
-   [ ] icons, friends
-   [ ] migrating contents
-   [ ] 404 page
-   [ ] external link icon (mask?) after pseudo element, align center, prevent line break
