朋友们都叫我 Jabriel, 我不通电脑，不懂游戏，我的一己之梦是成为一个讲故事的大师和一名英勇的打龙勇士。

我一直被那种优秀叙事的力量所吸引，无论是在书籍、电影，还是在游戏中。

有人把电子游戏归类为“第九艺术”。目前，我在[游戏引擎研发](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine)领域探索，尝试以代码构建扣人心弦的情节和令人沉浸的互动世界。

此外，我还是一名理论物理的业余爱好者，非常喜欢[费曼](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)。

今欲将此地视为我冒险路上的营地，我将在这里分享我的奇遇经历。

希望你会喜欢我的文字。

My friends call me Jabriel, I'm a computer newbie, a game noob, and I'm on a mission to become both a master storyteller and a skilled dragon-slayer.

I've always been drawn to the power of a good narrative, whether it's in a book, a movie, a video game.

Currently, I work as a [Game Engine Programmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) based in China, where I'm dedicated to creating the next-gen interactive world that bring joy and excitement to people around the globe. I strive to use my code to tell compelling stories and create immersive experiences that engage players on a deeper level.

In addition, I am also an amateur enthusiast of theoretical physics and I am particularly fond of [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman).

I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences in _programming, hobbies, and life_. As a fledgling dragon-slayer, I'll also share my adventures and lessons learned. I hope to tell captivating stories and experiences that both entertain and inspire, providing you with valuable insights along the way.
